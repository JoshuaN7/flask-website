### Create virtual environment

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate virtual environment

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Verify that pip list is clean

```sh
pip list
```

### Install modules (simon)

```sh
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy
```

### Direct pip3 installed modules and their versions into requirements.txt file 

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Create application.py file

The main file should be called application.py for seamless integration with AWS Elasticbeanstalk.

```sh
touch application.py
```

## Add simple code

```py
from flask import Flask
application = Flask(__name__)
app = application

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World'
```

## Test the flask website locally

1. Temporarily add application.py to PATH

```sh
export FLASK_APP="application.py"
```
2. Run the flask website

```sh
flask run
```

Then open the link after "Running on" to view the website. 

If everything looks good, hit `CTRL+C`to terminate the process.

3. Push the code to Github

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Test deploy"
git push origin main
```
